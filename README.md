Customer Orders Analysis :
This project involves analyzing customer order data from the orders.csv file, which includes columns such as order_id, customer_id, order_date, product_id, product_name, product_price, and quantity.
The Python script performs several key analyses: it computes the total revenue generated by the store for each month, calculates the total revenue for each product, and summarizes the total revenue for each customer.
Additionally, it identifies the top 10 customers by revenue. The steps include loading and cleaning the data, performing feature engineering, training a model, and evaluating the results to provide insights into 
sales performance and customer value.
